Single Linked list
    A single linked list is a list of nodes where each node has a single link to
    the next node in the structure
    Final Node links to nullptr

    Similar  to a queue
    head pointer: first node on  the list
    tail pointer: last node on the list

    Similar to stack/queue:
      Can only travel in one direction
      Stack node, queue node, or single linked list: all next pointers point to the next data
    Difference:
        Can insert or remove anywhere


Doubly Linked List
  List of nodes where each node has two links to previous and next
  Last node points to nullptr

  head: pointer to first node
  tail: Pointer to last node

  Can be traverse fowards or backwards

  Need to find element when inserting same with single link list
    But if you have a pointer to the specific index, you can just go there
    and go backwards

Container class: implement a data structure as a class an object oriented approach
