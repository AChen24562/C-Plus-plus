Single Linked list
    A single linked list is a list of nodes where each node has a single link to
    the next node in the structure
    Final Node links to nullptr

    Similar  to a queue
    head pointer: first node on  the list
    tail pointer: last node on the list

    Similar to stack/queue:
      Can only travel in one direction
      Stack node or queue node, or single linked list: all next pointer and data
    Difference:
        Can insert or remove anywhere
