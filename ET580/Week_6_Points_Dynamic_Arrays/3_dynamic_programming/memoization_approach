Recrusively compute fib sequence from the big problem
down to smaller problems (top down)

create an array with values defaulted to -1 to store solutions
assign 0 and 1 as the first values in the array



long fibonacci(int n, long* a){
if(n < 2) return value at a[n]

otherwise if a[n] has no value
  compute and store the result of fibo(n-1, a) + fibo(n-2, a)

otherwise return value at a[n]
}
