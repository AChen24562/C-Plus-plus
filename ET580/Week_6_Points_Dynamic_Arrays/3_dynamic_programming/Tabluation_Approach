iteratively compute a fib solution from subproblems
up to the big problem (bottom-up)



long fibonacci(int n){
  create an array to store subproblem answers
  assign 0 and 1 as the first values in the array

  iterate from 2 to n
      compute and store the result of n-1 + n-2

  return value at a[n]



}
