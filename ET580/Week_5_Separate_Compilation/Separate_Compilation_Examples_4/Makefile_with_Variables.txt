EX_5.4 Makefile with Variables FAQ
----------------------------------

Note: all files are identical to EX_5.3

A Macro variable OBJS can be defined to contain all .o file names as such:
OBJS = driver.o Person.o Job.o

This variable can then be accessed as follows:
$(OBJS)

If the variable content will span across multiple lines the '\' character
followed by a newline can be used to indicate the continuation of the line:
OBJS = driver.o Person.o \
       Job.o
