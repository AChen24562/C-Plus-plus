Errors:
  Concerns of an input value may cause a program to error

  Hanging if dividing by 0
  Previous methods:
    Terminate with error value exit(1);
    Assert
    METHODS ARE NOT GOOD BECAUSE THEY WILL TERMINATE THE PROGRAM WHEN PARAMETER
    IS NOT MET


  In a linear search, start from first to last element
  return -1 indicate an element in a list is not found, but is not understood by all

  Error handing and error information should be done better



Exception
  A method of handling errors to improve and simplify the flow of code

  Throw a signal that an exception (error) has occurred, incurs in a try block
  Try a block of code which has the potential for throwing an exception due to errors
    Test or looking for an error
    IF error occurs the try block will not run
  Catch a block of code which handles thrown exceptions from the try block



Templates
  function that does not require its parameters to be type specific
  such as a swap can be made simpler with templates

  template<typename T>
  Now in your function whenever you needed a type (string, int, etc) write T


  Type is based on what you call the function with

  Functions that can be applied to many different types
  Type is decided by the function call and is converted by the compiler
  into a typed function before run time

  Single type T, cannot be converted or casted, T can only be one type
  (T &a, T& b);
    Once compiler sees that a is an int, b cannot be a different type
    Templates Multiple types should be used instead for this situation


  Node: Object created to store data of other objects or variables
    Contains data that will connect it to the rest of the data structure

  Container: An object that stores a collection or data structure of other objects
    Provides member functions to interact with data
    responsible for encapsulating memory management
    Templitized Container class you can right one class for many different types
