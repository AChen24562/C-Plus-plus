Errors:
  Hanging if a certain parameter is met
  Errors from dividing by 0
  Terminate with error value exit(1);

  assert(b != 0) Terminate and print error

  In a linear search, start from first to last element
  return -1 indicate an element in a list is not found

Exception
  A method of handling errors to improve and simplify the flow of code

  Throw a signal that an exception (error) has occurred
  Try a block of code which has the potential for throwing an exception due to errors
    Test or looking for an error
  Catch a block of code which handles thrown exceptions from the try block

Templates
  function that does not require its parameters to be type specific
  such as a swap can be made simpler with templates

  template<typename T>
  Now in your function whenever you needed a type (string, int, etc) write T

  auto, realized by compiler
  Does not support automatic type conversion

  Type is based on what you call the function with
